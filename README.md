#Frogger
##Description
This a JavaScript version of the video game Frogger. The goal of the game is for the
player to reach the water at the top of the screen without touching one of the enemies.
If the player hits one of the enemies, they will be sent back to the starting
point at the bottom.

This was one of the projects in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. This
project gave students a chance to apply what was learned in the Udacity courses on object
oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

The player is controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard.
#Installation
